## Documentation

Documentation is always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch:

- The [latest release documentation page][site-release].
- The [latest release Javadoc site][javadoc-release].

Documentation is also generated from the latest snapshot, taken from the 'develop' branch:

- The [the latest snapshot documentation page][site-develop].
- The [latest snapshot Javadoc site][javadoc-develop].

### Building the docs

The documentation site is actually a Maven site, and its sources are included in the project. If required it can be generated by using the following Maven command:

```
$ mvn verify site
```

The verify phase is required, otherwise some of the reports won't be generated.

## Usage

To run the project locally use the following Maven command:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then you can query at [http://localhost:8080/entity](http://localhost:8080/entity), or use the [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html).

### Docker image

```
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --project-name association-app up
```
